# Install

## NovaOS (Browser)
- Open `novaos/index.html` in a modern browser.
- Optional: host with a static server for best performance and to relax some cross-origin restrictions.

## GitHub Pages
- Publish the `/novaos` folder from the `main` branch.
- Pages will serve `index.html` automatically.

## RustPyâ€‘Arch (Linux)
